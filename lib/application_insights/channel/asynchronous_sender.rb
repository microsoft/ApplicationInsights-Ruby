    # An asynchronous sender that works in conjunction with the {AsynchronousQueue}.
    # The sender object will start a worker thread that will pull items from the
    # {#queue}. The thread will be created when the client calls {#start} and
    # will check for queue items every {#send_interval} seconds. The worker thread
    # can also be forced to check the queue by setting the
    # {AsynchronousQueue#flush_notification} event.
    #
    # - If no items are found, the thread will go back to sleep.
    # - If items are found, the worker thread will send items to the specified
    #   service in batches of {#send_buffer_size}.
    #
    # If no queue items are found for {#send_time} seconds,  the worker thread
    # will shut down (and {#start} will need  to be called again).
